# Customized GVSU Illiad

---

These are the customized HTML files for our installation of Illiad. We've done extensive work in branding the application and customizing a lot of the crummy user interaction that Atlas Systems and OCLC are never going to get around to. Hope this helps you as you work on improving your own Illiad website!

## Features

We don't use all of Illiad's options. We only allow three types of requests: digital copies, loans, and theses. This is a lot easier for our users than trying to decide between a dozen different request types.

* See renewal status right from the homepage - if it is within an item's renewal window *and* renewals are allowed, you can renew with one click right from the "View items" table.
* Empty tables are hidden, and prompts are added to help novice users request items.
* Labels are made readable, forms are made accessible, and the whole experience is just better.
* Simplified manage account screen, since the largest source of errors were due to excessivly long forms required before you could use the dang website.
* There is no red text anywhere. None.
