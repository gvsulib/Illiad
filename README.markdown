#README - GVSU Illiad

---

These are the customized HTML files for our installation of Illiad. We've done extensive work in branding the application and customizing a lot of the crummy user interaction that Atlas Systems and OCLC are never going to get around to. Hope this helps you as you work on improving your own Illiad website!

CHANGES

We don't use all of Illiad's options. We only allow three types of requests: digital copies, loans, and theses. This is a lot easier for our users than trying to decide between a dozen different request types.

We also show all of the users requests on the home page: electronic articles, outstanding requests, and checked out items. We've also made renewing something that is simple and available right on the home screen. 

The site is also responsive, so it works as well on small screens as large screens.

SCREENSHOTS

Log in screen.

<img src="http://gvsulib.com/labs/img/illiad-home.png" />

Home page/View Items page. You can see all of your requests here, and can see whether renewals are allowed and/or renew the items directly from this page.

Article request form. The form is laid out on a grid, which reformats for small screens.

Manage Account screen. We've really simplified things, since the default screen overwhelms users and leads to a lot of disavowed accounts because they don't complete all the fields (2 addresses? Really?!?) We only ask for an address if you say you want us to ship books to you, because otherwise we don't need your address.
