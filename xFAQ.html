			<h3>What is ILLiad?</h3>

			<p>ILLiad is the electronic system you use to request an item through the GVSU University Libraries Document Delivery department.
The name ILLiad can be thought of as an acronym for <u>I</u>nter<u>L</u>ibrary <u>L</u>oan <u>i</u>nternet <u>a</u>ccessible <u>d</u>atabase.</p>

	<a name="better"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>How is ILLiad better than traditional ILL systems?</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>You will find it easier to submit your document delivery requests. With ILLiad, you enter your name, address, and other personal information into the system only once, at the time of your first request.</li>
				<li>Your request will be handled more rapidly and accurately as problems relating to misinterpretation of hand-written requests are eliminated.</li>
				<li>You can get many of your photocopies more quickly through Electronic Delivery.</li>
				<li>You can get information about the status of your request through the Web at any time from any location without having to call the Document Delivery Department.</li>
				<li>Library personnel are able to serve you better because all data about your request and its handling is stored in a searchable database. We are able to respond quickly to your
    				inquiries about your request. We are also able to gather statistical information about the
    				performance of the libraries that lend to us, enabling us to make better decisions when
    				choosing a lender to supply an item.</li>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Are there any disadvantages to the electronic system?</h3>

			<p>Some people might find it troublesome to have to log into ILLiad using a username and
			password. We believe this is less trouble than traditional paper and electronic systems
			which require you to enter your personal information with each new request.</p>
		</div>

	<a name="userid"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Why do I need a username and password to use ILLiad / Document Delivery?</h3>

			<p>Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about
			your interlibrary loan requests. We can also enable you to edit your personal information
			such as your address or phone number. </p>

			<p>Your username and password for ILLiad is the same as your GVSU network account.</p>

	<a name="webbrowser"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>What Web browser should I use?</h3>

			<p>You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and preferrably Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We recommend the current versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<a name="security"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</a></h3>

			<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
			This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
			using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
			your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
			security of your document delivery loan requests, you can take the following steps:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Access ILLiad only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
    			<!--<li>Access ILLiad from a public workstation in the Interlibrary Loan office in the library. These computers are supervised by the library staff.</li>-->
    			<li>When using a public access workstation:
					<ol>
    					<li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
    					<li>Exit from the Web browser before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back button from accessing the pages you were using.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Why don't I see all my older requests when I look at my request history?</h3>

			<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
			requests online for several years order to comply with record keeping requirements
			of the copyright law.</p>

			<h3>What is electronic delivery?</h3>

			<p>Many libraries ship photocopies of articles to us in electronic format. In the past we
			printed these articles before delivering them to you. Now, through ILLiad, we are able to
			offer you the option of electronic delivery of these articles in PDF format (Adobe's
			Portable Document Format). You can read more about electronic delivery on the <a href="ElectronicDeliveryInformation.html">Electronic Delivery
			Information</a> page.</p>

		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>I've moved why do I need to change my address on my Document Delivery account if I've changed my address with the university.</h3>
			<p>You need to change your address on your Document Delivery account too because it is a management package that helps you and the library keep track of books and articles obtained from other libraries. It is not maintained by Student Accounts and no other departments on campus can see this information. It tells Document Delivery where to send your books and articles.</p>
